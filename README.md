A crate that allows you to share memory between __processes__. Fork of [elast0ny/shared_memory](https://github.com/elast0ny/shared_memory).

This crate provides lightweight wrappers around shared memory APIs in an OS agnostic way. It is intended to be used with it's sister crate [raw_sync](https://github.com/elast0ny/raw_sync-rs) which provide simple primitves to synchronize access to the shared memory (Mutex, RwLock, Events, etc...).
